Growing up in a Cuban/Latine household, I developed a complicated relationship to gender. When I was nine years old, I asked my mother for a Pokémon themed birthday cake. She called [Vicky Bakery](https://www.vickybakery.com/), the go-to bakery for Cuban pastelitos, bocaditos, and catering for parties. And when she asked for the Pokémon themed cake for her “daughter,” they told her they only make Pokémon cakes for boys. I was so devastated; I wrote a letter to Santa Clause that year asking for a Pokémon cake. I remember complaining in the letter, but I didn't question Pokémon being "for boys" - I understood that it was a gendered interest. I liked Yu-Gi-Oh and Digimon, and I knew those were for boys. And I liked Barbies and Bratz dolls, and I knew those toys were for girls. 

I've told people this story, and some of them don't believe me - a (white) person asked me "Why would this bakery say Pokémon is for boys? What do they care, they're losing out on money by not selling you the cake." And I said to that person, they don't understand how rigid gender roles are in the Latino community.I would wear button-up polo shirts and long jeans to visit my family members, and they would often scold me for "dressing like a boy." I was told by my grandmother that I shouldn't play softball because that would lead to me having big, muscular arms, “like a man”. And with that entire cultural upbringing, it took me years after coming out as gay to realize I was also non-binary. Despite how often I was told how *gendered* things were *supposed* to be, I never really internalized it. (Realizing I'm autistic perhaps partially explains this, as [research shows](https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/largest-study-to-date-confirms-overlap-between-autism-and-gender-diversity/) there's a high correlation between gender diversity and autism).
 
I listened to the podcast where Oyèwùmi reflects on Yoruba culture and gender, and how universalism in academia imposed a particular, colonized worldview on her work. She mentioned a talk she gave, where one individual in academia told her that gender studies had been stressing that gender matters, and here Oyèwùmi came saying it wasn’t important. Her retort was funny - what she was presenting about her own culture proves their point exactly - gender is a social construct. Saying that gender is universal puts a biological essentialism to gender - that it’s something that isn’t culturally and socially constructed (whatever culture is), but inherent to us “biologically” as human beings. And that is simply untrue.

What constitutes a being Man :tm: in Western culture is very different from what it means to be a man in other cultures. Moreover, in this American culture, [racism plays a role in gender](https://scholarworks.uvm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1126&context=hcoltheses) - for example, Black women are masculined, Asian men are feminized.
Gender roles are fluid and shifting – did you know [pink used to be a “boy” color](https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/12/health/colorscope-pink-boy-girl-gender/index.html#:~:text=In%20fact%2C%20pink%20was%20even,of%20the%20Pantone%20Color%20Institute.)?

How can gender be universal if even one culture can’t make up their mind about what gender is supposed to be?
I’ve seen arguments by trans exclusionary radical feminists (T.E.R.F.s), where they try to (poorly) break down what gender is and explain why it is biological (it’s not). The conclusion I’ve come to from watching these videos is that it doesn’t so much matter what gender *is*, but rather what it *does*. Gender roles control people. Gender leads to performance, a performance one can choose to partake in. There’s even a performance and mythology to being outside the gender binary (the elusive [non-binary](https://s3-prod.adage.com/inline-images/NON-BINARY.png) skinny, white, adrogynous Woman Lite look). All this to say, gender isn’t universal, it’s a social construct. And trying to ascribe a universalism to it leads to Bad Things (like T.E.R.F.s and racism).

But I do hope to one day get that Pokémon cake for my birthday.
