Once upon a time, in a past life, I dated a tech bro who was an absolute hardcore fanboy of the Silicon Valley Elites, the likes of Peter Thiel, Elon Musk, and Paul Graham. Because of my devotion to this man, I suffered through reading an Elon Musk biography (after which I came to the conclusion that Elon Musk is an edgelord jerk with a large aparthied inheritance). I also read most of Paul Graham’s essays on his website, and stumbled upon one essay he wrote on the topic of [economic inequality](http://www.paulgraham.com/ineq.html). At the time, I didn’t quite have the words to say why Graham’s essay struck a nerve with me. I talked to my then-boyfriend about it, and he arduously came to Paul Graham’s defense; a poor college student from a working class family in rural Florida was arduously defending this whiney tech millionaire. Whyyyyyy?
After seeing [am unrelated bad take from Graham’s Twitter](https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1513917630515757057) recently, I reread his Economic Inequality essay to hurt myself - and after watching the documentary *Capital in the 21st Century*, I think I can safely parse out what’s wrong with the essay. 

Let me lay out the main arguments Paul Graham says in this essay:
1. Startups aren’t bad, they create wealth, not like those Wall Street goons!
2. Economic inequality is caused by many things, and they’re not all bad things!

To the first point, Paul Graham seems to be under the impression that startups “create wealth” (an empty phrase that he uses over and over again). Thinking back on the documentary, the end of it highlighted a very important idea - humans can be supplanted by technology. So technology is not the end-all-be-all for creating wealth, when it actually can lead to displacing a large portion of the workforce and leading to more economic inequality.
And as Holly Wood says in her [analysis of the essay](https://qz.com/586563/paul-graham-just-accidentally-explained-everything-wrong-with-silicon-valleys-world-view/), the way that startups are funded mean that they don’t generate wealth. It’s Paul Graham’s Y Combinator startup incubator that funds miniature Grahams using all his money - they’re not generating new wealth, they’re using wealth already given to them. This is akin to the inherited wealth that the documentary describes.

Here are a few choice quotes from Paul Graham’s essay:
> If the rich people in a society got that way by taking wealth from the poor, then you have the degenerate case of economic inequality, where the cause of poverty is the same as the cause of wealth. But instances of inequality don't have to be instances of the degenerate case.

They are! They all are. Where does Paul Graham think that wealth came from? It’s inherited wealth from landowners - old money historically takes wealth from the poor, limiting social mobility. And did Graham forget about exploitation? Would Jeff Bezos be able to run Amazon without exploiting workers and taking money from the poor? As the documentary pointed out, Facebook has paid less in taxes than most working teachers. 

>Many of these causes are bad, like tax loopholes and drug addiction. But some are good, like Larry Page and Sergey Brin starting the company you use to find things online.

That’s a bold assumption that Google was a good thing for this world. A great book that covers Google and algorithmic bias is [Algorithm’s of Oppression](https://nyupress.org/9781479837243/algorithms-of-oppression/).

>The real problem is poverty, not economic inequality.

I genuinely wonder where Paul Graham thinks poverty comes from. Part of what the documentary explains about economic inequality is that, when there’s a lot of it and you have a shrinking middle class, the “middle class” becomes almost as poor as the poorest in a society. There is no social mobility. So how do you tackle poverty, in that case? It is not merely a symptom, as Graham tries to assert.

>Poverty and economic inequality are not identical. When the city is turning off your water because you can't pay the bill, it doesn't make any difference what Larry Page's net worth is compared to yours.

As the documentary showed, if you tax the rich, society can develop a robust social safety net that can help meet everyone’s basic needs. So, yes, Larry Page’s net worth compared to mine does matter.

>It's not economic inequality per se that's blocking social mobility, but some specific combination of things that go wrong when kids grow up sufficiently poor.

I think the main issue with this statement is Paul Graham not knowing what it’s like to be poor - how the rich get richer and the poor get poorer in this capitalist system.

Perhaps Paul Graham should watch *Capital in the 21st Century* and learn literally anything to get him out of the Silicon Valley mindset. Even if he did watch it, he’d just make an asinine tweet about it. 

With this reflection, I hope to cleanse myself of Paul Graham and hopefully this essay can stop living rent free in my head.
