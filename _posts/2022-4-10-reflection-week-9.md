##immigration

While reading *Necropolitics*, I reflected on how my immigrant family fits into the systems of power in this country. I’m Cuban-American, and my immediate family members immigrated from Cuba to the United States (some are still living in Cuba). Cuba itself has a long history with colonization and the United States - we were a Spanish colony, the [U.S. occupied Cuba for a time](https://cri.fiu.edu/us-cuba/chronology-of-us-cuba-relations/), and in modern day we see the effects of this power relationship, especially with the [U.S. embargo](https://www.state.gov/cuba-sanctions/). The reading on [passports and passporting](https://www.proquest.com/docview/2034187887/D5F413FACF054008PQ/2?accountid=12768) contextualized a lot of my family member’s experience with immigration - and made me consider my own difficulties in traveling back to Cuba with my American passport (even as a young child). Both my parents came to this country in the early 90s, during [The Special Period](https://cubaplatform.org/special-period) of extreme economic hardship in Cuba after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.

Coming to the United States was difficult (to say the least), especially with travel and immigration restrictions. As stated in *Material practices of power – part I: passports and passporting*:
>passports become important when a non-privileged traveler without 'the right papers' crosses borders that her or his body is not known to or not supposed to be seen around those borders.

My mother refuses to go back to Cuba, even now after becoming a naturalized citizen; she can only travel to Cuba if she renews her Cuban passport, as Cuba will not recognize her American citizenship or American passport. The way I understand it, she’s afraid of the power of the passport - and what having a passport that says Cuba will say about her status.

My [redacted family member 1] came to the United States from Cuba via South America together with my [redacted family member 2], under the guise of tourism. They had forged passports, and while my [redacted family member 2] flushed their passport down the toilet,  [redacted family member 1] decided to keep it (and the U.S. government now knows they came here under a forged passport). At the time, the U.S. had a policy which gave Cuban refugees who touched American soil the right to stay in the U.S. and seek citizenship, colloquially known as the wet-foot, dry-foot policy. The policy is no longer in place, and as [one NPR article stated](https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2017/01/15/509895837/end-of-wet-foot-dry-foot-means-cubans-can-join-ranks-of-the-undocumented), Cubans can now join the ranks of the undocumented.

The state exercises control over immigrants in countless ways - but I’ll talk about my own personal experience with the healthcare system. When reading *Necropolitics*, I thought about the American healthcare system, my father, and the absolute nightmare that getting insured in this country is when you are an immigrant that doesn't speak English. He’s diabetic and hasn’t gotten proper treatment in years (arguably ever). When I tried to get him insured through the Affordable Care Act, the price in Florida was $700 a month. When he caught Covid last year,  I tried to help him get a Covid test so he could get sick pay - there were no resources in Spanish, I had to translate everything. 

This systemic inequality with a basic human right like healthcare is designed to be difficult for the Other - there is the perception of the Other as being a danger to those in power, “whose biophysical elimination would strengthen [their] potential to life and security.” As stated in *Necropolitics,* “biopower appears to function through dividing people into those who must live and those who must die.” Through my anecdotal experience, it’s clear to me that the US is sending the message that the immigrants are those who must die.

##empathy games

In part of my midterm assignment, I outlined the problems with empathy games with regards to queerness (but of course, this argument could be expanded to other groups). 
Considering the subject this week, I want to rephrase my argument from the midterm. My main gripe with empathy games is how they are positioned as serving those in power to understand the Other - in this framework, empathy games have no value outside of subjects in power; anna anthropy made Dys4ia for a queer audience, not for straight people to empathize with her.

In my Game Design Studio class, we talked about empathy games and designing games for a cause. In class, we saw a video on [making games for empathy and understanding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yVdhRyTxaM&t=1s&ab_channel=TED), where Brenda Romero, a white woman game designer, recounts the story of making a game about the Middle Passage (called The New World) for her 7 year old mixed raced daughter to understand slavery. She went on to explain a variety of other empathy games she made (including a game about the Holocaust called Train and a game called Mexican Kitchen Workers). The first question I had after seeing this video - should she be the one making these games?

Our assignment for this week in Game Design is to make a game that does or says *something*. I wanted to make a game about my immigrant family and the struggles they faced coming to America - living in Cuba, the immigration system, the barriers to understanding the English language. But with my positionality (my American passport, English fluency, higher education, and access to healthcare), should I be the one making that game? And who will the game be for? 

I think I want to make the game for myself, not for empathy, but for a cathartic exploration of my background and the lack of power my family holds in this country as immigrants.
