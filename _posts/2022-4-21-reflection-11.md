Both Anzaldua’s *Borderlands\La Frontera* and Diaware’s *Song of the Griot* had me reflecting on being between two cultures, and the hybridity that entails. As a Cuban-American (the hyphen a sign of the hybridity), I am *ni de aquí, ni de allá,* always between two worlds. But before the readings, particularly Anzaldua’s, I hadn’t considered the possibility of a hybrid as its own distinct thing. Mexican-Americans have the phrase *Chicano* to signify hybridity - it signifies its own identity and culture, an emergence of something else (like the phrase *mestizo/a*, it’s not *indio/a-español*).

For me, as Cuban-American, all I had was the hyphen and my late grandmother scolding me for trying to call myself Cuban (“*tu eres Americana, no eres Cubana. Yo soy Cubana.*”) She didn’t call me a hybrid, she called me *Americana*. And when I went back to Cuba, I was not Cuban either - I couldn’t remember simple words, I didn’t know any of the slang terms they used. But I could never see myself as just American, not without the hyphen. The mythology of the American that was shown to me in the media did not include a Spanish speaking household, a bilingual immigrant child, my tongue that could not parse out the right words in the right languages.

I can’t separate the Cuban parts of myself from the American parts of myself, they’re tied together, interwoven in the fabric of my hybridity. As Anzaldua wrote:
> “...I am cultureless because, as a feminist, I challenge the collective cultural/religious male-derived beliefs of Indo-Hispanics and Anglos; yet I am cultured because I am participating in the creation of yet another culture, a new story to explain the world and out participation in it, a new value system with images and symbols that connect us and each other to the planet.”

It struck me when Anzaldua wrote: 
>As a lesbian I have no race, my own people disclaim me; but I am all races because there is the queer of me in all races. 

I’m straddling three worlds - the worlds in my Cuban-American identity, and the queer world.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> For a long time, even after I knew I was gay, I didn’t identify with queerness. The world of the queer (at Wellesley) was so overwhelmed with whiteness that I couldn’t be a part of it. And after going to *La Fabrica de Arte* in Cuba, and seeing so much queer art there, I was able to see that queerness/cubanness could also exist together, and something new emerges from that hybrididty.

I recently wrote a [gaming manifesto titled Gaming ((queerly)(together))](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/170BDfYr7794eQzHK36z-RfcmamFDwWO7?usp=sharing) for my Game Design Studio course. I took a lot of the ideas for that manifesto from this course, particularly the midterm assignment. But that quote from Anzaldua helped me find the missing piece in my manifesto - “there is the queer of me in all races.” The togetherness that links me to my players, the queerness in all of us. In my manifesto, I wrote “When you play my games (alone?), we’re gaming together - I’m always playing with you.” We can all play games queerly.

<sup id="fn1">1. There is an (underground) queer world in Cuba which I’m not privy to.
