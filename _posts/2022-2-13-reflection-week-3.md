Before I could read, my father taught me to recite José Martí’s poetry; I would proudly perform *[Cultivo Una Rosa Blanca](https://www.poemas-del-alma.com/jose-marti-cultivo-una-rosa-blanca.htm)* and *[Los zapaticos de rosa](https://www.poemas-del-alma.com/los-zapaticos-de-rosa.htm)* for all my parent’s friends. Before I went to school and read sheet music, I learned children's songs from my mother. She sang so many songs - *[Mi Gatico Vinagrito](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyTmhWPE4G8),* *[Un Elefante Se Balanceaba](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=950AAFXgivk),* *[Duermete Mi Niño](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LemxZcOXCdg)* - and they all became a part of me. 

In middle school, I learned to read sheet music. My friends taught me how to play the piano and violin, and I went online looking up scores and taught myself to play classical songs. I invested so much time in perfecting the art of reading music notation. I felt like a whole world of knowledge had suddenly opened up to me - but there was a correctness in this new world, a prescriptiveness to music. It wasn’t like singing with my mother or reciting poetry for my father, who taught me the wrong notes and stanzas they misremembered. After all, the notes and rhythms were all clearly marked on the page.

In high school, I joined the jazz band as a pianist - and I SUCKED. The prescriptiveness and perfection that was so deeply ingrained in my classical musical journey was more or less useless now. Yeah, we had sheet music, I guess, but I felt like the notes on the page were laughing at me. The eighth notes weren’t straight eighth notes anymore - they had *swing* now, something that standard western music notation couldn’t quite capture. And there were these damn *solos* we had to play. What do you *mean* I have to make up a melody on the spot? My social anxiety was not having it. I never quite got the hang of it, and so I renounced jazz music performance as one of those things you either *get* or don’t get (like doing winged eyeliner or calculus). But I so badly wanted to *get* it, so recently I started listening to the book [How to Listen to Jazz](https://www.audiobooksnow.com/audiobooks/how-to-listen-to-jazz/1826765/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAr5iQBhCsARIsAPcwROML7nTbEDq0sz8tS3XIjjtkO5CXPrk0qq6SZGxDKYeRpiz5CTAS4M0aAh0VEALw_wcB)

Walter Ong’s *Orality and Literacy* readings had me thinking about jazz music and the musical pedagogy of orality versus literacy. In the United States where I was raised, we teach music in the traditional western notation system, teaching musicians to read music and reproduce what’s on the page, with some limited variations in musical expression, as long as it doesn’t deviate too much from what’s on the page. Jazz is a whole other beast, where the sheet music is more of a blueprint for playing music. It is a conversation between musicians, with a call and response in the solos and musical phrases, a community experience of playing together. What is said when performing disappears as soon as it’s played, much like spoken language in oral cultures. It’s an evanescent experience to be in a jazz club and listen to jazz musicians play; there’s a quality to it that recording can’t capture, as was said in the documentary *Being in the World*, jazz musicians play for the context they are in. Jazz is highly rhythmic, as are the collective memories in oral cultures. Jazz playing is an additive experience; you add to the musical phrases of your fellow musicians as you play. Unlike reading standard music notation, when you play a jazz solo, you can’t come back to it - if you’re interrupted, the magic is gone, and you likely won’t be able to play the same thing twice. There are rules to playing jazz music, what you might call a mnemonic device like in oral cultures, in the form of blues and chord progressions. While there are elements of orality in jazz, it’s not quite a one-to-one analogy, as we still oftentimes have written scores to guide us in playing. It’s a complex process, and jazz music is not quite in either the realm of the strictly oral or literate.

## McLuhan’s Tetrad and Music notation 

Contrasting the practice of jazz with classical music, I want to think more critically about musical scores. With McLuhan’s tetrad of media framework, I’d like to examine sheet music, or musical notation more broadly, as a medium. **Disclaimer**: I’m not an ethnomusicologist and haven’t researched this before, so these are just my superficial initial thoughts. 

Of course, there are many kinds of musical notation systems, each specific to different time periods and cultures. Different notation systems can denote different aspects of musical expressions - dynamics, pitch, rhythm, tempo, tablature. But what I want to specifically examine is the cultural media effects of putting music down on paper or stone, or any medium; any system that attempts to captures musicality - whether that be describing how to play an instrument for a specific song (like tablature), denoting pitches but not rhythms (like early western music), or [graphic scores](http://davidhall.io/visualising-music-graphic-scores/).

### Enhances
Music notation enhances human memory and the body of music that can be collected in a society. You can now have a virtually unlimited repository of cultural music at your disposal, without the strict need for collective human memory to be a limiting factor. With musical notation we get a more-or-less enduring and homogenous body of music for a culture and society. 

### Obsolesces
Music notation obsolescence variations in musical expression, standardizing the way music can be played. We no longer need humans to teach and pass down musical information, it can all be written down. A culture can denote exact musical phrases, leaving (ideally) little to no ambiguity in what a piece of music is supposed to sound like. In practice, this is not always possible, as different notation systems cannot encode all possible forms of musical expression.

### Retrieve
Music notation retrieves music as a communal act. Music notation makes it possible to have multiple voices in a piece of music, where several people can sing their distinct parts. Music no longer has to be a godly act, with monophonic Gregorian chants.
Moreover, music becomes an activity for the people. Like with the printing press making religion accessible to the masses, music can be reclaimed by the masses. One can learn music without the strict need for a master/teacher.

### Reverses
Ironically, with the written notation, music can stifle expression, as there is now a *correct* way of playing things. Instead of being a communal act, musicality becomes a solitary activity, with one person striving to learn their part perfectly. 

There is some ambiguity in the tetrad and some overlap in the arguments I’ve made. It’s become clearer what *enhance* means, as a technology becomes an extension of the human mind. Retrieves is perhaps the most difficult concept in the tetrad for me, and I’d need more background on music history to fully understand music notation as a technology. I’ll have to revisit this tetrad in the future.

Lastly, looked for some readings on orality in music, and there are quite a few articles I’d like to get back to. Here’s a list I’ve compiled:
