Using the mediation theory framework in Peter-Paul Verbeek’s *Beyond Interaction: A short Introduction to Media Theory,* I want to think about games. What kind of human-technology relations are video games? There are, of course, different kinds of video games, but I want to think about video games where we play as characters or avatars in a world. This can also apply to tabletop top role playing games, which are story driven games where players role play as characters, usually all done on pen and paper.

Looking at the types of relationships in mediation theory, perhaps video games can fit into the *embodiment* relationship. We, the humans, use the technology bestowed to us by video game consoles or Dungeons and dragons modules to act on a world - schematized as (human - video game) -> world. The problem with the word “world” in this context is that the world isn’t *our world,* it’s a contrived and created world. Maybe we can update the schema as (human - video game medium) -> video game world.

Does it matter that the world isn’t *real* in video games? From a phenomonologist’s point of view, we interact and interpret the world through our embodied interactions - the mind can’t be separate from the body. But can the body be separate from the real world - or can we have two bodies and two worlds existing simultaneously?

Or is this video game relationship to humans more of an *immersion* relationship, where technologies are part of an interactive context. The video game world responds to the player through their “embodied” interactions with it. Human -> technology/world might become something like Human -> the video game world, as the technology/world are one in the same.

This can be especially true for virtual reality games, where you are immersed inside a 3D environment. Some games may not even give you a body, you are a disembodied floating head in space. Some games give you floating arms and limbs, disconnected from a body. How does one make sense of the virtual and made-up world without a body to connect it to? An anecdote: one time, I was playing a VR game where the loading screen was you flying down from a building. I looked down and I didn’t have a body, but I was still falling through space. I had to shut my eyes and brace myself on the ground to feel my body again and keep from getting nauseous - it was an alien feeling, a scary moment to not have a body in the world.

I would say, for the most part, there is a virtual embodiment in video games. To some extent, we become the character we play - especially if we have a role in customizing it. Thinking about the body, I think about being transgender. I’m nonbinary myself, and the transgender experience and relation to the body is very particular. Part of it may be dysphoria, part of it may be a mind/body disconnect (although this might be bringing the issue into medial essentialism), but video games allow us to transcend the body, a body that never felt like ours to begin with. Creating an avatar means taking ownership of our embodiment and creating a body that we can see as ours.

What about multiplayer games? What happens when you introduce another human being into space and the world? Does it become (human-human) -> technology/world, where you co-op in navigating and exploring a world together. That doesn’t seem right, as both humans are mediated by the technology - their virtual embodied interactions are seen through the lens of the virtual world. Or maybe it’s still human-technology -> world, and the other human becomes part of the world. But that doesn’t account for the other human’s interactions in the world… they’d become a backdrop. Then you get non-playable characters (NPCs), who are part of the world, but don’t have any subjectivity. There's an interesting intersubjectivity here, where both humans can manipulate and alter the world, and be aware of each other’s being.

I played a game once called [Journey](https://thatgamecompany.com/journey/). It starts as a single player open-world experience, where you wander around, and it turns into a two player game. The way I played the game changed drastically when someone else came into the world. Did they *become* part of the world, though? Or was I navigating the world with them? Potentially both.

The world of embodiment in video games is worth exploring - especially the implications for trans embodiment in games.
